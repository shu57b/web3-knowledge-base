## What is a Wallet Address?

A wallet address is a randomly generated string of characters connected to a blockchain wallet. It's used to receive cryptocurrency transactions to that wallet, and the wallet owner can generate an address at any time.

## Note: The format of a wallet address depends on the cryptocurrency

The format of a wallet address depends on the cryptocurrency, and it's important to use the right type of address. For example, Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) wallet addresses are different from Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) wallet addresses. To receive Ethereum, a wallet owner needs to generate an Ethereum address. A Bitcoin address wouldn't work, and, <mark>if cryptocurrency is sent to the wrong type of address, it's lost and unrecoverable.</mark>

## Differences between BTC and ETH wallet addresses

### BTC wallet addresses:

* Bitcoin wallet addresses have between 26 and 35 characters and consist of both letters and numbers. They start with either "1," "3," or "bc1." Here's an example of a Bitcoin address:
**1Lbcfr7sAHTD9CgdQo3HTMTkV8LK4ZnX71**

* With some cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, each address you generate is different. Previous addresses are still tied to your account and can be reused. 

### ETH wallet addresses:
* Ethereum addresses are 42-character hexadecimal addresses. They're generated using the last 20 bytes of the wallet's public key and by adding "0x" to the front. Here's an example of an Ethereum address:
**0x1ABC7154748D1CE5144478CDEB574AE244B939B5**

* With other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, wallet addresses don't change.

## How to get a wallet address

To get a wallet address, you need a blockchain wallet. There are quite a few options available, including digital wallets and hardware wallets. Digital wallets, also known as hot wallets, are software on a computer or smartphone and are free. Hardware wallets, also known as cold wallets, are devices you buy that store crypto offline.

## Public key, private keys and wallet addresses

* Blockchain wallets, also known as crypto wallets, have two types of keys: public ones and private ones. The public key is like an account number where other users can send transactions. The private key grants access to cryptocurrency funds in that account, similar to a password.

* A wallet address is a hashed version of the public key. The blockchain wallet runs the public key through a hashing function to generate the wallet address, which is a string of characters representing that public key. Transactions sent to the wallet address are effectively sent to the public key, ensuring they reach the right user.

* On the subject of wallet keys, there's one extremely important rule. You can share your wallet's public key, but you should never share its private key. Since the private key provides access to the account, anyone who has it could steal your cryptocurrency.

## How to Create an Ethereum Wallet Address From a Private Key?

Ethereum Wallet Address is a distinct alphanumeric crypto identifier that contains 42 hexadecimal characters that start with 0x and is followed by a series of 40 random characters which can send transactions and has a balance in it. 

* For example, 0xdB055877e6c13b6A6B25aBcAA29B393777dD0a73 is a type of Ethereum address. 

* The unique address is required to receive funds from another cryptocurrency network and to access it, you should have your own private key. 

* In order to access your private key, you must have your own wallet such as MetaMask, CoinBase, or TrezorOne to name a few.

## How cryptography is used cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrencies use cryptography for three main purposes; to secure transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets. To accomplish all of these things, cryptocurrencies rely on what is called “public key cryptography.”
