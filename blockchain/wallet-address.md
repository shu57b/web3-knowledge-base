## What is a Wallet Address?

A wallet address is a randomly generated string of characters connected to a blockchain wallet. It's used to receive cryptocurrency transactions to that wallet, and the wallet owner can generate an address at any time.

## Note: The format of a wallet address depends on the cryptocurrency

The format of a wallet address depends on the cryptocurrency, and it's important to use the right type of address. For example, Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) wallet addresses are different from Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) wallet addresses. To receive Ethereum, a wallet owner needs to generate an Ethereum address. A Bitcoin address wouldn't work, and, <mark>if cryptocurrency is sent to the wrong type of address, it's lost and unrecoverable.</mark>

## Differences between BTC and ETH wallet addresses

### BTC wallet addresses:

* Bitcoin wallet addresses have between 26 and 35 characters and consist of both letters and numbers. They start with either "1," "3," or "bc1." Here's an example of a Bitcoin address:
**1Lbcfr7sAHTD9CgdQo3HTMTkV8LK4ZnX71**

* With some cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, each address you generate is different. Previous addresses are still tied to your account and can be reused. 

### ETH wallet addresses:
* Ethereum addresses are 42-character hexadecimal addresses. They're generated using the last 20 bytes of the wallet's public key and by adding "0x" to the front. Here's an example of an Ethereum address:
**0x1ABC7154748D1CE5144478CDEB574AE244B939B5**

* With other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, wallet addresses don't change.

## How to get a wallet address

To get a wallet address, you need a blockchain wallet. There are quite a few options available, including digital wallets and hardware wallets. Digital wallets, also known as hot wallets, are software on a computer or smartphone and are free. Hardware wallets, also known as cold wallets, are devices you buy that store crypto offline.
